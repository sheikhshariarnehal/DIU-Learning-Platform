# Featured Course Default Content - Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Feature Overview

This feature ensures that when users open the app, they automatically see content from the **last recent Featured/Highlighted Course** by default, with **syllabus content prioritized** when available.

---

## 🚀 What's New

### Priority Order for Default Content Display:

1. **Featured Course Syllabus** (if available)
2. **Featured Course Other Study Tools** (if no syllabus)
3. **Featured Course Slides** (if no study tools)
4. **Featured Course Videos** (if no slides)
5. **Any Default Content** (fallback if featured course has no content)

---

## 📋 Implementation Details

### 1. API Endpoint Enhancement

**File:** `app/api/content/highlighted-syllabus/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- Modified the endpoint to return ANY content type from the featured course
- Implements a cascading search strategy:
  - First looks for syllabus
  - Then other study tools
  - Then slides
  - Then videos
- Returns 404 only if the featured course has absolutely no content

**Content Types Returned:**
- `syllabus` - For syllabus study tools
- `study-tool` - For other study tools (previous questions, mark distribution, etc.)
- `slide` - For course slides
- `video` - For course videos

---

### 2. Frontend Page Enhancement

**File:** `app/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Updated `initializeHighlightedContent()` function (renamed from `initializeHighlightedSyllabus`)
- Now handles all content types, not just syllabus
- Shows appropriate toast notification based on content type
- Displays content type in the notification:
  - "Syllabus: [Title]"
  - "Slide: [Title]"
  - "Video: [Title]"
  - "Content: [Title]"

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### When a user opens the app:

1. **Check for Shareable URL**: If URL contains a shareable link, load that content
2. **Load Featured Course Content**: If no shareable URL:
   - Fetch content from highlighted/featured course
   - Show toast with content type and title
3. **Fallback**: If no featured course content, load default content

### Content Selection Logic:

```typescript
Featured Course → Syllabus Found? → YES → Load Syllabus
                                  → NO  ↓
                                        Other Study Tools? → YES → Load Study Tool
                                                           → NO  ↓
                                                                 Slides? → YES → Load Slide
                                                                         → NO  ↓
                                                                               Videos? → YES → Load Video
                                                                                       → NO  ↓
                                                                                             Load Default Content
```

- Verify the `is_highlighted` flag in the `courses` table
